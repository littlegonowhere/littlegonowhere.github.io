			<p>You find yourself in the middle of a dark forest. There's nothing around but electronic trash.</p>
			<p>The sky above is grey, the trees made of plastic.</p>
			<p>You are a bit hungry. If you will not eat soon you may die!</p>
			<p>There's a tree close by, with things hanging from the top.</p>
			<p>Fruit for sure!</p>
			<p>And not just any old fruit, but tasty sandwiches.</p>
			<button id="eat">Pick &amp; Eat!</button>

		<div id="middle">
			<p>Yum! You feel satisfied.</p>
			<p>As you reach to pick another sandwich, you find a note stuck to the tree.</p>
